## Overview of Project:Using Kickstarter Data to help Louise with her project campaign

### Purpose: To visualize campaign outcomes based on their launch dates and funding goals


## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date: 
Converted the Date Created Conversion column from the original Kickstarter sheet into a new Years column which I used in addition to Parent Category and Outcomes to create a pivot table. A line graph pivot chart was also created to help visualize the outcomes.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals: 
A new sheet was created to compare the goals and percentages of successful, failed and canceled outcomes by using the function CountIfs. A line graph was created to help visualize the outcomes.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered: 
When creating the pivot chart, it was a challenge to adjust the time to months to get a clear understanding of the outcomes by launch date. However, by using the Excel Documentation under the Hint section, I was able to group
the data and format it into months.


## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date? The summer months, (May, June, July) had the highest successful outcomes, but also the highest failed outcomes compared to other months. The reasoning behind the higher trended data may be due to people taking vacation or time off and are more prone to watching theater shows during that time. 

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals? With the increased goal amount, it seems like there was a high fail percentage outcome with some exceptions. 

- What are some limitations of this dataset? One limitation may be that we didn't capture all the goal amounts when we determined our Outcomes Based on Goals results, higher goal amounts were not included in this data set. Another limitation could be that the lengths of the campaigns start from the year 2009 to 2017, no other data is present for outside that time period, which could give us different results.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create? A clustered column or clustered bar graph could have also been used to visualize the results.
